# AI-Exercise

You are part of our AI squad. Our clients have approached us to build a quick proof of concept before they request for funding of a project. They would like to eventually create an automated alert system that would identify potential anomalies in financial data.


Your task is to:
- prepare, wrangle and clean the data
- analyze patterns in the dataÂ 
- (Optional) prepare model that will be able to detect anomalies

The data for this exercise can be access from here: https://ibm.box.com/s/97lnlr5dmvdnepnspkh8gf4ckjsvfywh. The zip file contains SQL scripts from PostreSQL and include data and database schema. You need to create your own database environment which can be queried for further analysis. It is sufficient if your solution is local only but you can also leverage cloud offerings (e.g. cloud.ibm.com offers Lite versions that are for free).

Submit your solution to a separate Github repository (www.github.com) and share with github accounts: xmatoha, petereon, srmeier and natasa-plulikova. Alongside your solution please also include a Readme file with necessary information on how users can interact with your solution and brief presentation of your outcomes. Feel free to include your thoughts, ideas and recommendations for next iteration. You can submit your solution in Jupyter notebooks or plain Python. Timeline for the exercise is 1 week.
